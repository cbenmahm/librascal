Contributing to libRascal
-------------------------

Thank you for contributing to libRascal!  To make sure your pull request gets
accepted with a minimum of hassle for everyone involved, please make sure first
and foremost that you've read the ``README`` [*]_, especially the section
entitled "Helpers for Developers", which contains details on the formatting
functions that you should run on your code before sending a pull request for
review.  (Note that the use of auto-formatters isn't mandatory, but your code
*must* pass the various linters that are run with ``make lint``; this is part of
the automated CI build.  Any code that has been auto-formatted should pass the
linters; please open an issue if this is not the case for your code).  If the
linter fails on your code, the pull request will be sent back for revision
without any further comments.

It is also a good idea to browse the
`developer's guide <https://lab-cosmo.github.io/librascal/dev_guide/developer.html>`_,
especially the
`coding conventions <https://lab-cosmo.github.io/librascal/dev_guide/coding-convention.html>`_
for C++ code (Python code generally follows PEP 8).

We now have a pull request template; please use it (especially for new
features)!  In particular, make sure you've checked off all the items listed
under "Tasks before review".  If you haven't been able to complete all these
tasks, then your code isn't ready for review; consider submitting a "Draft pull
request" instead (or waiting to request reviewers).

.. [*] You'd think this would be obvious, but far too many people ignore
       ``README``\ s in practice

Summary of the review process
===============================

A detailed description can be found in a separate document about the `review
process <https://lab-cosmo.github.io/librascal/dev_guide/review_process.html>`_

For developers
 * We want a clean and tested master branch, which is why we review code and use
   continuous integration tools.
 * Contact us if you have any questions.
 * Start the discussion about your contribution early by using the
   Draft-Pull-Request feature of Github.
 * Use our Pull-Request template in preparing your PR.
 * Provide tests for the new/changed functionalities in the test suite of the library.
 * Make sure your proposed changes pass the all existing tests, change (not
   deactivate) them if necessary.
 * Document your contribution.

For reviewers
 * The first person to make a full review is responsible for seeing it through.
 * Single line comments are ok, but consider a proper review.
 * If you started a review, you are responsible for seeing it through.
 * Finish the PR fast by reviewing the requested changes.
 * If you start changing code on a PR as a reviewer, ask another person to
   review you code.

Jupyter Notebooks
=================

Please read the `README section <README.rst#jupyter-notebooks>`_ on this topic.
In general, avoid contributing
code in notebooks wherever possible.  If you do have to commit notebooks to
version control, make sure you've installed the ``nbstripout`` extension and
that it works properly (i.e. you're not committing the output of notebook
cells).  Any pull requests that include diffs of notebook outputs will be
sent back without further comments.  The two exceptions to this rule are:

1. Deleting existing, committed outputs (a rebase may be requested to prevent
   those outputs from making it into the history in the first place)

2. Stable outputs for example notebooks meant to be processed to HTML for the
   `tutorials page <https://lab-cosmo.github.io/librascal/tutorials/tutorials.html>`_.
   "Stable" here means these are the final outputs meant to be shown to the
   public and won't be changed unless errors or omissions are discovered, or the
   tutorial is later updated or expanded.  Note that tutorials that rely on
   volatile code features should *not* have their outputs included, since in
   that case the tutorials themselves aren't stable; instead, you should use the
   auto-execution feature of ``nbsphinx`` (see
   `here <https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/executing-notebooks.html>`_
   for details).

Note also that ``nbstripout`` will not strip output from cells with the metadata
fields ``keep_output`` or ``init_cell`` set to ``True``.  Please use these
fields judiciously.
